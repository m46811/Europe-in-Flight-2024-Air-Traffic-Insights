The airport_traffic_2024.csv file contains detailed air traffic data for European airports in
2024, total flight counts, and other operational metrics reported by the Network Manager
(NM) and airport operators (AO). It supports analysis of airport performance, traffic trends,
and air navigation efficiency.

The data is provided under the Performance Review Commission (PRC), established in 1998
by EUROCONTROLâ€™s Permanent Commission. The PRC delivers independent advice on
European air traffic management performance through research, data analysis, and
stakeholder consultation, ensuring a transparent and effective review of the European ATM
system, which makes it a reliable data source. 

The repo contains the following workbooks:

Sourcing Open Data
Exploring Relationships
Geograpical Visualization with Python
Supervised Machine Learning: Regression
Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering
Sourcing and Analysing Time Series Data 

# Hypotheses:
## 1.Traffic distribution will vary significantly by country, with larger or more tourist-focused countries (e.g., Italy, Spain, France) experiencing higher total flights compared to smaller countries.
## 2.There is a consistent growth in total flight traffic from early spring to summer each year, followed by a gradual decline into autumn and winter, reflecting seasonal travel demand.
## 3.Major hub airports (e.g. London Heathrow, Paris CDG, Frankfurt, Amsterdam Schiphol) will have the highest total flight traffic in 2024, while smaller regional airports will have the lowest.
